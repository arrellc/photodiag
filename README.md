## Description
The Photon Arrival and Length Monitor (PALM) is a device at SwissFEL for temporal diagnostics of the photon beam. It measures the arrival time of an FEL pulses relative to the pump laser pulses in the experimental hutches, as well as the FEL pulse lengths.

This repository contains code for data analysis of waveforms acquired by the PALM setup.
